0.0.1 / 2017-11-24 (Thanksgiving Day!)
==================

  * Initial release

0.1.0 -refactor / 2017-11-26
==================

  * This is basically what Quasi should have been, a more simple pipeline. The scope creep of that project really torpedo'd it, but I like the ebb and flow and how it brought me to this point. I could actually see quasar become the underlying engine for Quasi, and Quasi becoming the quasar generation tool.
